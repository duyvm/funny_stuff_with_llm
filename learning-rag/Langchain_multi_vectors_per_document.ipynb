            "\n",
            "We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children. \n",

            "The scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do. \n",

            "We’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.  \n",
            "\n",
            "And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.  \n",
            "\n",
            "If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks. \n",
            "\n",
            "We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward. \n",
            "\n",
            "And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week. \n",
            "\n",
            "Second – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants. \n",
            "\n",
            "If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.  \n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "Third – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need. \n",
            "\n",
            "It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \n",
            "\n",
            "We’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \n",

            "Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \n",
            "\n",
            "And with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \n",
            "\n",
            "We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, continuing this costs money. \n",
            "\n",
            "I will soon send Congress a request. \n",
            "\n",
            "The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \n",
            "\n",
            "Fourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \n",
            "\n",
            "We’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \n",
            "\n",
            "And we won’t stop. \n",
            "\n",
            "We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \n",
            "\n",
            "Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \n",
            "\n",
            "We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \n",

            "The document outlines the author's journey through early writing and programming experiences from childhood to graduate school. It begins with their initial attempts at writing short stories and programming on an IBM 1401 in junior high. The author describes a turning point with the advent of microcomputers, which made programming more accessible and interactive. After acquiring a TRS-80 and developing simple programs, the author initially planned to study philosophy in college, believing it to explore ultimate truths. However, upon discovering the limitations of philosophy courses, they switched to studying artificial intelligence (AI), influenced by works of fiction and documentaries that fueled their passion for intelligent systems.\n",

            "In graduate school, the author came to a realization that contemporary AI, particularly natural language processing, was fundamentally flawed and did not equate to genuine understanding. This led to a shift in focus toward Lisp programming, culminating in writing a book on the subject, \"On Lisp.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Throughout the narrative, the author expresses disillusionment with systems work, highlighting its transient nature and lack of lasting impact. A key moment of clarity came during a visit to an art museum, where they recognized the permanence and independence of artistic creation compared to software development. In the end, the author contemplates pursuing a path in art, drawn by the idea of creating lasting works without the constraints of academic or corporate structures.\n"
